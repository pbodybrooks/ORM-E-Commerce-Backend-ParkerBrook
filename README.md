## Installation 
Clone the repository to your local machine, add MySQL credentials to a copy of the .evn example file, and install dependencies. Then, run the schema.sql to create the ecommerce database.

## Usage 
Once installed, start the server with npm start and, optionally, npm seed to add seed data to the database. Once the server is live, an application like Insomnia can be used to manually create GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests.
